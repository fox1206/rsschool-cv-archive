## About me
I recently left the banking industry and now I spend all my free time studying Frontend development.
I'm interested in web development because I see career opportunities. There are many quality free resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I know that my ability to learn and acquire new skills will help me become a good Frontend Developer.
